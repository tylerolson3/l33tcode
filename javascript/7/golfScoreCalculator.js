Description:
I have the par value for each hole on the golf course and my stroke score on each hole. Im tired of calculating it by hand. Can you write a program that calculates my golf score for me?
Task Overview
Write the method golfScoreCalculator/GolfScoreCalculator which accepts two strings and calculates the golf score of a game. The two arguments can always be assumed to be strings. In Javascript, the length of these two strings will always match.
Usage Examples
golfScoreCalculator("453454444344544443", "354445334534445344") => -1
*/
function golfScoreCalculator(parList, scoreList) {
  const par = parList.split("").reduce((a, b) => a + b * 1, 0);
  const score = scoreList.split("").reduce((a, b) => a + b * 1, 0);
  return score - par;
}
