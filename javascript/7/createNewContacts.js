Description:
You are the Dungeon Master for a public DnD game at your local comic shop and recently you've had some trouble keeping your players' info neat and organized so you've decided to write a bit of code to help keep them sorted!
The goal of this code is to create an array of objects that stores a player's name and contact number from a given string.
The method should return an empty array if the argument passed is an empty string or nil/None/null.
Examples
Have at thee!

function playerManager(players) {
  if (players === null || players.length === 0 || !players.length) return [];
  let arr = [];
  let p = players.split`,`;
  for (let i = 0; i < p.length; i += 2) {
    arr.push({ player: p[i].trim(), contact: p[i + 1] * 1 });
  }
  return arr;
