Description:
Task
You are given two strings s and t of the same length, consisting of uppercase English letters. Your task is to find the minimum number of "replacement operations" needed to get some anagram of the string t from the string s. A replacement operation is performed by picking exactly one character from the string s and replacing it by some other character.
About anagram: А string x is an anagram of a string y if one can get y by rearranging the letters of x. For example, the strings "MITE" and "TIME" are anagrams, so are "BABA" and "AABB", but "ABBAC" and "CAABA" are not.
Example
For s = "AABAA" and t = "BBAAA", the output should be 1;
For s = "OVGHK" and t = "RPGUC", the output should be 4.
Input/Output
[input] string s
Constraints: 5 ≤ s.length ≤ 35.
[input] string t
Constraints: t.length = s.length.
[output] an integer
The minimum number of replacement operations needed to get an anagram of the string t from the string s.

    .filter((v) => !isNaN(v) && v > 0)
    .reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
